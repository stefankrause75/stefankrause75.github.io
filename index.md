# My Benny fan page

Benny is an 80ies lego spaceman in the lego the movie series. Benny is a good friend of emmet and absolutely reliable unless he sees a spaceships. Spaceships are Benny's big love and when he sees one he get's really exited and forgets the world around him. 
Bennys helmet is fractured just as all lego spaceman helmet were broken in the 80ies.
